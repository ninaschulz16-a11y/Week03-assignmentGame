# Week03-assignmentGame

This project was a fun and challenging way to practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS together. I started by creating a simple clicker game where the main goal is to click on a takoyaki image to increase the counter. Then, I added upgrades fetched from an API, allowing the game to grow automatically over time.

I could practice selecting elements, handling click events, how some functions work and where to use them, and overall DOM manipulation.

State management – storing game progress in localStorage so the game remembers upgrades and counters even after refreshing.

CSS layout and styling – using flexbox to organize the main image and stall side by side.

Animations – creating a moving background to make the game feel dynamic and lively.

One challenge I encountered was arranging the stall next to the main image without adding extra wrappers, which I solved by using flexbox with minimal HTML changes. I also experimented with making the upgrades visually appealing while keeping them readable against the background.

Overall, this project helped me understand how all parts of web development work together: the structure (HTML), the style (CSS), and the behavior (JavaScript). It also reinforced the importance of small, incremental changes and testing frequently to avoid breaking the layout.

I had to "re-start" many times as I got lost in all the changes and at many points of the work (mainly when I was working on the style and extras )something "broke" , and it was simply easier for me to start over again, rather than trying to find where it went wrong. Reflecting on such practices helped me figure out better and more time efficient ways to work, but that is in itself work in progress. 

In future projects, I hope to dedicate more time for styling details, like adding sound effects when we click on the takoyaki (planned on doing so with this project, but everything took longer than expected) or when we purchase something from the stall, or adding thumbnail images to each part of the stall.
